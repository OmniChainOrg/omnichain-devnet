# 🛠️ OmniChain DevNet Bootstrap

Welcome to the **OmniChain DevNet**, the simulation-aware, validator-ready testnet powering the world’s first AI-anchored blockchain for scientific integrity.

This repo enables trusted organizations, research labs, biotech entities, and humanitarian allies to spin up a **Proof-of-Authority (PoA) validator node** that verifies *truths* — not transactions.

---

## 🌟 What Is OmniChain?

OmniChain is a private, modular, non-financial blockchain infrastructure for:

- Verifying **AI model provenance**
- Anchoring **simulation integrity**
- Scoring **clinical logic** through explainable AI
- Powering decentralized biomedical R&D
